# 1. 1️⃣ “Do NOT store critical data only in UI state”

User taps "Save"
↓
Validate input
↓
INSERT into SQLite (success)
↓
Update UI state from DB

# 2. 2️⃣ “Do NOT use implicit meaning”

❌ Bad example
type INTEGER
-- 1 = debit
-- 2 = credit

Looks harmless now.
Six months later:
You forget what 1 means
You add 3 = transfer
CSV export shows 1,2,3 (useless to user)
Import logic becomes fragile

❌ Even worse
status = 0

What is 0?
pending?
deleted?
failed?
active?
Nobody knows.

✅ Good (explicit) example
type TEXT

Stored values:

"debit"
"credit"
"transfer"

Benefits:
CSV is human-readable
Imports are trivial
No mental decoding
Future-proof

# 3. 3️⃣ “Do NOT change column meaning later”

This one causes silent data corruption — the worst kind.
❌ Example of changing meaning

Version 1:
amount = expense amount (always positive)

Version 2:
amount = signed value
-- debit = negative
-- credit = positive

Old rows:
500 → what does it mean now?

Now:
Reports break
Old CSV imports lie
No way to know original intent


✅ Correct approach

Column meaning is sacred.

If meaning must change:

Add a new column
signed_amount

Keep old column untouched
Migrate data explicitly
Document change
